# GAforStrings2020
 Code and experiment with a basic genetic algorithm (GA) that tries to evolve character strings to match a given target string.

GOAL STRING: 
"I think this is a reasonable medium sized string!!"

Experiment Results:

SELECTION METHODS
Boltzmann, rank, and tournament

CROSSOVER PROBABILITIES
0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0

MUTATION
0.0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2

FITNESS MEASURES
make 3 of our own



Summary of Code:
This code provides three different selection sorts for a given generation of individuals. In doing so, we are able to compare how close our genetic algorithm comes to producing the goal string, "I think this is a reasonable medium sized string!!"
